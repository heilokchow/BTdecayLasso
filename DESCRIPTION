Description: We apply Bradley-Terry Model to estimate teams' ability in paired comparison data. Exponential Decayed Log-likelihood function is applied for dynamic approximation of current rankings and Lasso penalty is applied for variance reduction and grouping. The main algorithm applies the Augmented Lagrangian Method described by Masarotto and Varin (2012) <doi:10.1214/12-AOAS581>.
